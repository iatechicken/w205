# Assignment 09

- In order to make data informed decisions at the mobile game company QWER, we have to set up a data pipeline that would log the api calls that our mobile apps are making to our web services. We will be using flask and kafka to log the events and then use spark to pull the events, potentially filter it, and then write them to storage. Please refer to iatechicken-annotations.

iatechicken-history2.txt was the main terminal and iatechicken-history.txt was the second terminal used for testing
